# Pointers for Software Engineers [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/vicoyeh/pointers-for-software-engineers.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/vicoyeh/pointers-for-software-engineers)

_A curated list of topics to start learning software engineering_

Pointers for Software Engineers is a complete open-source computer science curriculum, designed to cover the fundamentals and practical topics of software engineering most relevant to the industry today. Think of it as an alternative or supplement to college or bootcamp education. It aims to serve as a guidebook for beginners planning to make a career transition into software engineering, computer science students looking to expand their practical knowledge, and experienced engineers curious to seek references for other subject matters.

Each topic in this curriculum includes only a single reference for readers to gain familiarity and understanding in a short period of time. Tutorials with clear content structure and hands-on examples are selected over other references. Some would say it is taking a breadth-first search approach to computer science learning.

This curriculum is divided into four major sections: fundamentals, advanced, tracks, and subjects. Fundamentals cover the core part of computer science and are often required as the lower-division courses in universities. Advanced goes more in depth on various computer science subjects and are usually topics discussed in upper-vision university electives. Tracks outline the most common software engineering roles and provide relevant topics for introductory understanding. Subjects offer content for specialization fields researched in corporate research labs and startup initiatives.

If you are just starting, it is recommended to go through the fundamentals in order, then pick a subset of advanced topics to read at will. For the curious ones, use tracks and subjects as references when choosing career options that most interest you.
